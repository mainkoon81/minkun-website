# Welcome to my website!

I am a scholar dedicated to understanding the complexities of our stochastic world. This website offers a window into my research, publications, and selected findings accumulated over years of academic and applied work. My research interests lie at the intersection of Bayesian computing, quantitative finance, data engineering, and energy markets. I also have a personal interest in data-driven urban planning. Here, you’ll find a selection of my published work, along with recent insights and ongoing developments from my current studies.

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:kimmk0810@gmail.com) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
