ESRS (EU Sustainability Reporting Standards) developed by EFRAG (EU Financial Reporting Advisory Group) provides mandatory reporting standards under the **CSRD** (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) in the EU. ESRS define how companies must report on sustainability-related impacts, risks, and opportunities. They include two cross-cutting standards (ESRS 1 and ESRS 2) that explain the general principles, reporting structure, and required company-wide disclosures. The **environmental standards** `(E1–E5)` cover climate change, pollution, water and marine resources, biodiversity, and resource use and circular economy. The **social standards** `(S1–S4)` focus on a company’s own workforce, workers in the value chain, affected communities, and consumers. Finally, the **governance standards** `(G1)` addresses ethical business conduct, including corruption, lobbying, and transparency. ESRS operationalises `DMA` to assess both inward financial risk and outward environmental effect.

# Case Study - Reporting Standards regarding E1

The chemical production company *Kinove AG* is in the process of preparing its sustainability report according to **ESRS**. The different sources of emissions and their amounts have to be correctly allocated to the **scopes of emissions**. <u>Through its `Double Materiality Assessment` (DMA), the firm has identified all **ESRS E1 Disclosure Requirements** to be material for its report.</u>

In the year 2018, *Kinove AG* has implemented a management strategy to **reduce carbon emissions by the year 2035 by more than 50 %** relative to the base year 2016. This strategy was approved by the both the executive and supervisory board and its progress is regularly reported. To achieve this objective, the firm plans to replace `20 % of its truck fleet` with `battery-powered vehicles` that can be used for last-mile delivery of goods and are readily available to replace the current combustion engine based fleet. In the current reporting period, *Kinove AG* **already achieved a GHG reduction of 10 %** compared to 2016. While the Chief Marketing Officer suggested to support a **carbon removal project** that is freezing CO2 in Greenland, the CEO was not convinced of the initiative and decided not to support it. The €200,000 cost which would have been associated with the initiative were instead used to build a **kindergarten** that is open to both children from employees and the public.

The *Kinove AG* estimated that – for now – there are no potential financial effects due to climate related risks or opportunities. In addition to the activities described in Table 1, *Kinove AG* has GHG emissions of `195,813.33 tons` in **Scope 1**, `47,378.25 tons` in **Scope 2**, and `115,448.73 tons` in **Scope 3**.

## \[A\]. Emission Calculation

For each of the firm's activity described in `Table 1`, let me explain which scopes of CO2 emissions are being addressed. Let's calculate the amount of CO2 emissions associated with the selected scope in each situation.

![**Table 1.** Key production information of *Kinove AG*](images/emit_info.png){width="1000"}

![**Scope 1** emissions are the direct greenhouse gas emissions from sources a company owns or controls, such as its factories and vehicles. **Scope 2** emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy, such as electricity, heating, or cooling, and are reported separately because they are closely linked to a company’s energy use. **Scope 3** emissions include all other indirect emissions along the value chain and are divided into upstream emissions (e.g., raw materials, suppliers, and transportation) and downstream emissions (e.g., product use, distribution, and disposal), typically making up the largest share of a company’s total footprint.](images/SCOPE.jpg){width="500"}

::: callout-note
**activity 1** ⇒ `{Scope 1}`: Due to the company paid fuel card (controlled by the firm), a car usage as transportation is considered as a direct emission. <u>Therefore, `EMISSION = 5.7 tons` in Scope 1.</u> Although private car use (might be Scope 3) might need to be excluded from Scope 1, 95% ((227,760 – 11,388) / 227,760) were already associated with the business, thus for the sake of simplicity, we assign 100% of emission to Scope 1 while disclosing that car is also used privately.

**activity 2** ⇒ `{Scope 1 + 3}`: Own freight truck fleet is a direct scope 1 emission while leased vehicles is scope 3. Therefore, 
$$
\begin{aligned}
EMISSION &= 0.25 \times 25 \times 223 \; \text{tons} = 1,393.75 \; \text{tons (in Scope 3)} \\
EMISSION &= 0.75 \times 25 \times 223 \; \text{tons} = 4,181.25 \; \text{tons (in Scope 1)}
\end{aligned}
$$ 

**activity 3** ⇒ `{Scope 2}`: They are indirect emissions from electricity. Therefore,

$$
EMISSION = 70,000\;\text{kWh} \times 0.0004 \; \text{tons/kWh} + 1,200 \; \text{tons} = 1,228 \; \text{tons (in Scope 2)}
$$ 


**activity 4** ⇒ `{Scope 3}`: The CFO used a business jet (a chartered jet not under direct operational control), while four delegates and one intern used commercial flights. In response, the company attempted to offset the emissions by paying for the planting of 1,000 trees at €2.99 per tree, each covering 0.1 tons of emissions. However, the compensation is recorded as zero, because total emissions must be reported in gross terms under *ESRS E1, AR 20(d)*(Gross reporting means emissions must be disclosed before any offsets or compensation are deducted.). Based on the following, the total emission is <u>`EMISSION = 51.27 tons` in Scope 3 (oneway).</u>\
$$
\begin{aligned}
EMISSION_{CFO} &= 9,178 \;\text{km} \div 750 \; \text{km/h} \times 2 \; \text{tons/h} = 24.47 \; \text{tons (in Scope 3)} \\
EMISSION_{del} &= 4 \times 5.9 \; \text{tons/h} = 23.6  \; \text{tons (in Scope 3)} \\
EMISSION_{int} &= 1 \times 3.2 \; \text{tons/h} = 3.2  \; \text{tons (in Scope 3)}
\end{aligned}
$$


**activity 5** ⇒ `{Scope 3}`: They are indirect emissions from employee commutes. Therefore,  
$$
\begin{aligned}
EMISSION_{old} &= 1,500 \times 20 \;\text{days} \times 12 \;\text{months} \times \text{x} \; \text{tons} = 25,000 \; \text{tons (in Scope 3); x=5/72} \\
EMISSION_{a} &= 750 \times 16 \;\text{days} \times 12 \;\text{months} \times 5/72 \; \text{tons} = 10,000 \; \text{tons (in Scope 3)} \\
EMISSION_{b} &= 750 \times 20 \;\text{days} \times 12 \;\text{months} \times 5/72 \; \text{tons} = 12,500 \; \text{tons (in Scope 3)}
\end{aligned}
$$

**activity 6** ⇒ `{Scope 3}`: They are indirect emissions from waste management. However, as the firm donates the items, the indirect emissions from end of life waste management (for waste 
generated in operations, **Draft ESRS E1 AR 26** "Waste generated in operations") are not
considered. The waste is no longer the company’s waste once it is donated. Here, Scope 3 would only consider direct waste or downstream waste through sold 
products. <u>Therefore, `EMISSION = 0 tons` in Scope 3.</u>

## \[B\]. Developing Disclosure Requirements

Now, let's prepare the **disclosure requirements** of ESRS E1 as far as possible considering the information provided above. Whenever information is not available, we state what the firm shall provide in terms of disclosures.

- No actions were undertaken during the reporting year.

::: 

Note that, according to ESRS, **transition plans** show the relationship between firms' sustainability activities, climate goals and corporate strategies. **Policies** refer to tactics within the firm to address specific sustainability matters covered by the transition plan.
