ESRS (EU Sustainability Reporting Standards) provides mandatory reporting standards under the **CSRD** (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) in the EU. ESRS define how companies must report on sustainability-related impacts, risks, and opportunities. They include two cross-cutting standards (ESRS 1 and ESRS 2) that explain the general principles, reporting structure, and required company-wide disclosures. The **environmental standards** `(E1–E5)` cover climate change, pollution, water and marine resources, biodiversity, and resource use and circular economy. The **social standards** `(S1–S4)` focus on a company’s own workforce, workers in the value chain, affected communities, and consumers. Finally, the **governance standards** `(G1)` addresses ethical business conduct, including corruption, lobbying, and transparency.

# Case Study (a) - S1 Social Reporting

*ClimAID Services AG* in Bochum is preparing the social section of the sustainability report in accordance with **ESRS-S1**. At this stage, the focus is on the preparation of the `Metrics and Targets disclosures`. The relevant disclosure requirements have been highlighted in red in the attached file. Other ESRS-S1 components such as `policies`, `targets`, `training hours`, `health and safety`, etc. will be addressed separately at a later stage. We have received HR info covering both head counts and FTE (full-time equivalent), measured on an end-of-year basis.   


![**Figure 2.** ESRS Social Disclosures (November 2025 Amended ESRS)](images/DR_AR.png){width="1000"}

Before drafting the disclosures, we are considering whether `workforce-related metrics` should be reported using **end-of-year** or **annual averages** figures (how many employees the firm has?).

- Arguments in favor of using **year-end head count** figures: 

  - Potential alignment with other financial and non-financial reporting data, which is typically presented on an end-of-year basis.
  - Improved consistency across reporting sections
  - When combined with average figures, end-of-year data can help illustrate the magnitude of workforce fluctuations during the reporting period.

- Arguments in favor of using **averages** figures: 

  - Annual averages may better reflect intra-year workforce dynamics, such as seasonal hiring, temporary contracts, dismissals, or voluntary leave.
  - Additional hiring during the year is captured more accurately in average values than in a single point-in-time measure.
  - Reduced scope for disclosure management, as averages are less sensitive to timing effects around the reporting date.


## \[A\]. S1 Disclosure Prep with Excel

Let's prepare the relevant tables or graphs in Excel for the KPIs and breakdowns (by gender, country, contract type) specified in the Application Requirements (AR) shown in Figure 2. The excel spreadsheet contains 14 columns and 30,798 rows describing employee information for *ClimAID Services AG* in Bochum.

::: callout-note

- choose: Data > Filter (by Gender) > Ctrl+Shift+Down for basic tasks.
- Right next to the last column, create a dummy column (with 1) called "headcount" and activate **Pivot table**
  - Add a new sheet, and from it, choose: Insert > PivotTable: ctrl+a

  - A pivotTable panel appears. In the panel on the right, choose the variables to create a table.

## \[B\]. Difficulties with S1

Let me name difficulties we could likely encounter when working with files like these to prepare ESRS disclosures (for social matters specifically and ESG matters in general). Let me describe briefly how could we mitigate these problems.

- **General** file issues for ESG reporting
  - Data may not be available in one file so needs to be collected from different departments/countries. ⇒ `Plan sufficient collecting time`.
  - Multiple files, not structured or formatted in the same way ⇒ `To merge files, provide with data template to fill in`.
  - Typos, missing lines, inconsistencies in data ⇒ `employ sanity check, checking by filltering, etc.`

- Potential file issues for **S1**
  - Confidentiality issues due to sensitivity of data on payment and personal information ⇒ `anonymize data or let local data managers carry out calculations; firm-wide data would then be aggregated` 
  - Calculating AVG or fluctuations might be difficult, if file is based on end-of-year data ⇒ `obtain data that covers intra-year flow of personell` 
  - Data might need to be broken down into more detail (e.g., salary broken down into fixed and variable components) ⇒ `plan necessary analyses ahead to avoid receiving data in an aggregated format`
  - File may not cover individual deals (e.g. sabatticals, maternal/paternal leave, sick days, …) ⇒ `plan necessary analyses ahead to avoid receiving data in an aggregated format`




# Case Study (b) - S1 Social Reporting

Let's say the CAP GmbH & Co. KGaA is a rapidly growing manufacturer of hydrogen-powered vehicles in Germany. In its German and Austrian facilities, white-collar workers are on a 38.75 hours 5-day work week enjoying 30 days of vacation per year. In the U.S., white-collar workers usually work 7.5 hours on each of the six workdays per week after accounting for vacation. CAP's only production facility is located in the U.S. where blue-collar workers account for 75% of the total U.S. workforce. Blue-collar workers are scheduled on average 15% more hours than white-collar workers.

The data provided below is from each factory management of the three facilities in Germany, Austria, and the U.S. for each quarter of the current reporting period.

![](images/tab.png){width="1000"}

CAP needs to prepare a disclosure according to S1.36c and S1.AR25 (**DR S1-13**: Health and Safety Metrics). According to the relevant Draft ESRS, it shall report:


![](images/dr s1.png){width="1000"}


## \[A\]. Data point computation for reporting I

Considering the disclosure requirements in S1.36c, let's calculate the number and rate of recordable work related accidents a.k.a the accident frequency rate (AFR) for each country as well as for the company in total (i.e., over all countries) in the dimension commonly used for its reporting on an annual basis (
Assuming that one year consists of 52 weeks). 

::: callout-note
$$
\text{AFR} = \frac{NO.of.cases}{total.hours \times population} \times 1,000K 
$$


For Germany,
$$
\text{AFR}_{GER} = \frac{1}{38.75h \times (52week-30days/5days) \times 100 workers} \times 1,000K = 5.61
$$
For Austria,
$$
\text{AFR}_{AUS} = \frac{2}{38.75h \times (52week-30days/5days) \times 250 workers} \times 1,000K = 4.49
$$

For USA,
$$
\text{AFR}_{USA} = \frac{12\times 1,000K}{\underbrace{0.25*[7.5h \times 6d \times 52w \times 1500 p]}_{\text{white-collar workers}}+\underbrace{0.75*[7.5h(1+0.15) \times 6d \times 52w \times 1500p]}_{\text{blue-collar workers}}}  = 3.07
$$


For firm-wide,
$$
\text{AFR}_{firm} = \frac{1+2+12}{\underbrace{178,250}_{\text{Germany}}+\underbrace{445,625}_{\text{Austria}}+\underbrace{877,500+3,027,375}_{\text{USA}}} \times 1,000K = 3.31
$$

## \[B\]. Data point computation for reporting II

The CAP GmbH & Co. KGaA is considering a takeover of the CUber AG based in Herne, Germany. CAP's board of directors, however, is unsure whether the working conditions at CUber are too unsafe and may prohibit the takeover. **If the accident frequency rate (AFR) exceeds the one of CAP by more than 20%, the deal fails**. 

In the current reporting year, 6.7‰ (1/1,000) of CUber's employees had an accident on average per year. At CUber, the average employee works for 8 hours on 220 days a year. CUber has 
a total number of 240 employees. 


::: callout-note

Let's see if the deal fail based on the accident frequency rate criterion. 
Note that the yearly accident rate of CUber is 0.0067. This means
$$
\text{Annual Accident rate} = \frac{1.608 \text{accident_count}}{240workers} = 0.0067
$$

Therefore,
$$
\text{AFR}_{new} = \frac{0.0067}{8h \times 220days} \times 1,000K = 3.81
$$
Let's reconcile CUber's accident frequency measure with the dimension used for S1 reporting and compare the values for the whole firm between CAP and CUber. Note that **If the accident frequency rate (AFR) exceeds the one of CAP by more than 20%, the deal fails**. This means
$$
\text{+20 percent of AFR}_{firm}:3.31 \times (1+0.2) = 3.97 \quad \text{vs} \quad \text{AFR}_{new} : 3.81
$$
Therefore, the deal does not fail based on the AFR criterion.
