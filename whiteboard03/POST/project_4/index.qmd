![ONLY ``Enviropnmental objectives"..EU-Taxonomy does not address S or G objectives. what counts as an environmentally sustainable economic activity? WHat is your % of business (economic activities) that is really GREEN?](images/6objectives.png){width="1000"}

EU-Taxonomy is developed to create a common language on what Green activity is...to reduce ``green washing" and improve comparability. Using EU-Taxonomy, a firm can determine what economic activities are ENVORONMENTALLY (not Social or Governance-wise) sustainable under the conditions:
- Technical Screening Criteria (to see significance)
- DNSH (not to significantly harm others)
- Meeting Minimum Social Safeguards (to respect human right) 


![](images/taxonomy step.png){width="1000"}


To meet the E-objectives - Climate, Water, Pollution, Biodiversity, Circular Econ -, a firm discloses `what % of their business` that is  <span style="color: green;">Green</span>...in terms of Revenue (what a firm does now), CAPEX (what a firm does for future), OPEX (how a firm supports its operation).  



# Case Study - EU Taxonomy Analysis

The construction company *Gensler AG* is preparing its nonfinancial report in accordance with the **EU Taxonomy regulation 2020/852** (EU) for its most recent financial year. To prepare for the EU Taxonomy reporting process, the firm analyzes its **activities** according to its existing operating segments. The geographic segments reflect the operating focus of the business as well as its presence in key international regions and markets. 



## \[A\]. If being mentioned: taxonomy-eligibility

According to the **Disclosures Delegated Act** (EU) 2021, a `taxonomy-eligible` economic activity refers to an economic activity that is described in the **Delegated Acts** where <span style="color: red;">**technical screening criteria**</span> are defined for each environmental goal (Art.1 **par.5** Disclosures Delegated Act). All remaining economic activities, that are not described in the Delegated Act, are `taxonomy non-eligible` (Art.1 **par.6** Disclosures Delegated Act).

For *Gensler AG*, we are preparing their EU Taxonomy disclosure with regard to `taxonomy-eligibility`. The activities are listed in Table 1. We consider if these economic activities are described in the `Climate` **Delegated Act** (Comm. Del. Regulation (EU) 2021/2139).  

![Table 1. Gensler AG segments and activities](images/table01.png){width="500"}

::: callout-note
**activity 1** Construction of new building ⇒ `{taxonomy-eligible}`: **described** as activity 7.1 of the Climate Delegated Act

**activity 2** Renovation of existing building ⇒ `{taxonomy-eligible}`: **described** as activity 7.2 of the Climate Delegated Act

**activity 3** House keeping contracts ⇒ `{taxonomy-non-eligible}`: **not described** in any delegated act (yet)

**activity 4** Retail sales of construction materials ⇒ `{taxonomy-non-eligible}`: **not described** in any delegated act (yet)

**activity 5** General management ⇒ `{taxonomy-non-eligible}`: **not described** in any delegated act (yet)

## \[B\]. If meeting criteria: taxonomy-alignment

According to the **Disclosures Delegated Act** (EU) 2021/2178, a `taxonomy-aligned` economic activity refers to an economic activity that complies with the requirements laid down in **Art.3 of Commission Delegated Regulation** (EU) 2020/852 for each environmental goal (Art.1 **par.2** Disclosures Delegated Act).

- **Art.3 of Regulation** (EU) 2020/852: An economic activity shall qualify as environmentally sustainable where that **your economic activity**....
  - i) **contributes** substantially to one or more of the six environmental objectives.
  - ii) **does not significantly harm** any of the environmental objectives (DNSH).
  - iii) is carried out in compliance with the **minimum social safeguards** (basic human rights, labor, and anti-corruption standards based on OECD, UN, and ILO principles).
  - Complies with the <span style="color: red;">**technical screening criteria**</span> set out in Delegated Acts for the respective environmental objective.

*Gensler AG* is preparing their EU Taxonomy disclosure with regard to `taxonomy-alignment`. In Table 2, activities are listed. Considering the economic activities described in the `Climate` **Delegated Act** (Comm. Del. Regulation (EU) 2021/2139), let's see if they are `taxonomy-aligned`, and meet the climate-change mitigation goal 

![Table 2. Gensler AG activity description](images/taxonomy01.png){width="500"}

::: callout-note
**activity 1** Construction of new building ⇒ `{taxonomy-aligned}`: 

**activity 2** Renovation of existing building ⇒ `{taxonomy-not-aligned}`: 

**activity 3** House keeping contracts ⇒ `{NA}`: 

**activity 4** Retail sales of construction materials ⇒ `{NA}`: 

**activity 5** General management ⇒ `{NA}`:

## \[C\]. Calculating the taxonomy-eligible/aligned quotas

To comply with the EU Taxonomy, *Gensler AG* must report the **taxonomy quotas** for the current reporting year. Officially, the reporting output shall be presented as suggested by the regulation (Table 3). However, *Gensler AG* is first preparing a rough draft for filling in this table. Let's assume that **activity 1.** (Construction of new building) and **activity 2.** (Renovation of existing building) are covered by the description in the **Disclosures Delegated Act** towards the environmental objective of climate change mitigation.

![Table 3. Example of turnover table](images/taxxx.png){width="1000"}



![Table 4. Total turnover, capital expenditures, operating expenses](images/t4.png){width="500"}



![Table 5. Additional information on taxonomy-alignment of activities](images/t5.png){width="500"}

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Taxonomy-Eligible Quota} &= \frac{\text{Taxonomy-Eligible total}}{\text{Total for segments (Revenue/CAPEX/OPEX) }}\\
\text{Taxonomy-Aligned Quota} &= \frac{\text{Taxonomy-Aligned total}}{\text{Total for segments (Revenue/CAPEX/OPEX) }}
\end{aligned}
$$

- [i]. Let's calculate the **taxonomy quotas** for `taxonomy-eligible` activities (eligible turnover, CapEx, OpEx) per <span style="color: red;">activity</span> using the information in Table 4.
![](images/a.png){width="1000"}
- [ii]. Let's calculate the **taxonomy quotas** for `taxonomy-eligible` activities (eligible turnover, CapEx, OpEx) for the <span style="color: red;">whole firm</span> using the information in Table 4.

$$
\begin{aligned}
SUM_{activities} &= 0.2818 + 0.2364 +.. \text{for Revenue} \\
SUM_{activities} &= 0.155 + 0.35 +.. \text{for CAPEX} \\
SUM_{activities} &= 0.1316 + 0.3184 +.. \text{for OPEX}
\end{aligned}
$$

- [iii]. Let's calculate the **taxonomy quotas** for `taxonomy-aligned` per <span style="color: red;">activity</span> using the information in Table 4 and 5, assuming that the CEO wishes to report quotas that are as high as possible.
![](images/b.png){width="1000"}

- [iv]. Let's calculate the **taxonomy quotas** for `taxonomy-aligned` activities for the <span style="color: red;">whole firm</span> using the information in Table 4 and 5.

$$
\begin{aligned}
SUM_{activities} &= 0.2682 + 0.1568 +.. \text{for Revenue} \\
SUM_{activities} &= 0.1175 + 0.338 +.. \text{for CAPEX} \\
SUM_{activities} &= 0.1 + 0.24 +.. \text{for OPEX}
\end{aligned}
$$

## \[D\]. Potential for Double-Counting 

In Annex 1, par 1.2. Disclosure Delegated Acts, firms have to explain how they avoid **double-counting** in the allocation of Revenue, CAPEX, OPEX across activities. 

The subsidiary of *Gensler AG*, *Sasaki*, will be consolidated in the nonfinancial report of 
*Gensler AG*. *Sasaki* is engaged in **similar economic activities** as its parent company. Since *Gensler AG* only has contracts with customers where both new buildings are constructed and existing buildings are renovated simultaneously, the `taxonomy-aligned` turnover, CapEx, and OpEx are allocated towards both economic activities by the financial reporting department. Due to differences in the DNSH check, the `taxonomy-aligned` values partly vary between the two economic activities even though they stem from the same underlying contracts. Table 6 reports the values for both economic activities separately as well as for the total firm. 

![Table 6. Taxonomy-aligned turnover, CapEx, OpEx of Sasaki](images/t6.png){width="500"}

Let's say the CEO of parent company *Gensler AG* wishes to report taxonomy quotas that are as high as possible. Now let's calculate the taxonomy-aligned turnover, CapEx, and OpEx for the subsidiary *Sasaki* according to the EU taxonomy regulation and considering the CEO’s objective. 


![Table 7. Additional information on Sasaki](images/t7.png){width="500"}





::: callout-note
**issue**: double-counting possible (not allowed)

- Solution I.
![](images/p1.png){width="1000"}

- Solution II.
![](images/p2.png){width="1000"}



- Allocation of activities only to objective **construction of new buildings** yields the highest taxonomy quotas as requested by the CEO. The reported values are subject to the individual allocation decision made by firm management and not objectively justified by the EU taxonomy regulation.
